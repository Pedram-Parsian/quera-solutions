This repo contains all the solutions to [quera](https://quera.ir/) questions I have solved so far.

Each question has it's own directory, which is the question_id,containing the question itself in pdf format and also the solution.

Feel free to suggest better solutions for these questions, I'm always looking for a more *pythonic* way of solving them :wink:.

## Requirements
Most questions are solved with standard library and usually there is no need to install a third-party package; But if one is needed, there will be in a `requirements.txt` file beside the solution.

## Contributing
This repository is intended to contain *my* solutions to quera questions, but any suggestion for more pythonic way of solving questions are welcome.
